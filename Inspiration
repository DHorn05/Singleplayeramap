I want the player to feel claustrophobic and feel the up bringing of starting from nothing to escaping and living through madness of the sewers

-The setting obviously takes place in the sewers, you were running through the apocoylpes and was forced to take refuge in the sewers
to find out that the sewers are also overrun by evil.
-Every room contains evil and a reward for defeating the evil in that arena.
-Noone has been in the sewers in years its all ran down and there is algea everywhere.
-The water is dangerous, the spaces are tight and you have to use movenment to your adventage.
